### "What a week, huh? Captain, it's Wednesday"

This is a simple Telegram Python-based meme bot that primarily sends the *"what a week, huh?"* meme to your Telegram room **every Wednesday at 11:11 AM in the Europe/Berlin timezone**.

The bot uses threading and job scheduling within the script, so no cron job setup is required.

The repository is dockerized, and the only required runtime environment is the ï»¿`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
